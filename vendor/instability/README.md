## Overview

This is a fork of the [Stability](https://crates.io/crates/stability) crate with the
[blessing](https://github.com/sagebind/stability/issues/12) of the original maintainer Stephen M.
Coakley ([@sagebind](https://github.com/sagebind)). This crate provides attribute macros for
specifying API stability of public API items of a crate. For a quick example:

```rust
/// This function does something really risky!
///
/// Don't use it yet!
#[instability::unstable(feature = "risky-function")]
pub fn risky_function() {
    unimplemented!()
}
```

Please check out the [documentation] for detailed usage.

## Installation

Install via Cargo by adding to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
instability = "0.3"
```

### Supported Rust versions
